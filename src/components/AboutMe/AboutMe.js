        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I am a young, ambitious full-stack developer with a passion for new technologies. I find it fascinating to see how technology alters our lives, and I aim to help make this a better, more connected world by creating software that makes lives simpler.</p>
        <p>I had my first contact with programming at the age of 17 but ended up studying law. During my college years, I spent almost all my spare time (and a fair amount of time when I should have been studying law) learning about programming and the latest technologies. Eventually, I became proficient in Python, Javascript and some frameworks. It didn't take long before I realized that coding was much more fun and, it was better suited to my skills and abilities. That's why I have decided to pursue a programming career, turning my hobby into my profession.</p>
